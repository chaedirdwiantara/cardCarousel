**CARD CAROUSEL**

**Feature**
- [x] Swiping
- [x] Focus Effect
- [x] Tap to Expand
- [x] Close Transition

**Requirements**
**1. Card Carousel:**
  - [x] Cards should scroll horizontally.
  - [x] The card in the center should visually stand out (e.g., scaling up or glowing).

**2. Tap to Expand**
  - [x] When a card is tapped, it should animate into a larger, full-screen view.
  - [x] The transition should feel natural and responsive.

**3. Tap to Expand**
  - [x] Include a button to close the detailed view.
  - [x] The animation should reverse seamlessly, bringing the card back to its
original position.

**4. Expo Integration**
  - [x] Use Expo to set up the project and leverage animation libraries such as
react-native-reanimated or react-native-gesture-handler.
In this case i'm using Animated from react-native to handle the animation.

**5. Performance**
  - [x] Ensure smooth performance on both iOS and Android devices.

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
  - In this project, I drew inspiration for the design from Meta Threads' background and expanded images. The horizontal card carousel was inspired by random designs I came across casually.
  - I created the project using React Native Expo as instructed. I deleted unused code and files, then created the necessary component files. I implemented clean code principles to ensure the code is readable and manageable for other users. To be honest, I focused mainly on meeting the requirements, so I didnâ€™t pay much attention to other aspects. However, if I had more time, I believe I could have developed the project further.
  - One issue I faced during development was ensuring the scrolled image stopped in the middle of the screen when the scroll animation ended. To achieve this, I configured the interval, gap, and width of the components while also paying attention to the overall appearance to ensure it looked good.
